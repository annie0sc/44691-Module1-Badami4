# Half Day 1
Sepotember 7th, 2020
* It was given as a paid holiday due to labor day.
* I worked in UI mostly in module so to try a new group i have joined Stories adn sprint planning to learn new features/things and work on the tasks being assigned to me.


# Half Day 2
September 9th, 2020
* After module 1 , this is our first class and meeting with Dr.Badami where we were instructed to work as a single team with collaboration and develop a Single app.
* As a member of Stories and sprint planning, we must assign tasks to all the users for working on the project which helps them to work at a faster pace and so we started to collect all Jira id's of the members and to add them to the board for assigning tasks.

* To implement this, we had a zoom meeting with all my team members.
